# Lab | MLOps Deployment from PROD to DEV

## Participants:

Developer: [Lina]

Gatekeeper: [Alrumaysa]

## Tools and Technologies:

- Python 3.12.9
- Git & GitHub
- Virtual Environment (venv)
- requirements.txt
- Jupyter Notebook 

## Steps Followed:

#### Developer Role:

- Created a new project containing a main.py file (or used an existing one).
- Set up a virtual environment using venv and activated it.
- Installed necessary packages using pip install.
- Generated a requirements.txt file using pip freeze.
- Initialized a Git repository using git init.
- Excluded the venv folder from being tracked.
- Pushed the project to GitHub using git remote and git push.
- Created a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub.

#### Gatekeeper Role:
- Reviewed the Pull Request and ensured the code was clean and error-free.
- Merged the Pull Request into the main branch.
- Pulled the latest changes from GitHub using git pull.
- Created a new virtual environment and installed dependencies from requirements.txt.
- Ran the project successfully without errors.
- Provided feedback to the developer on any potential improvements.

## Role Swap:

The roles were swapped, and both participants successfully repeated the process, ensuring each person had the experience of both development and review.

## Challenges Faced:

- Initially, the venv folder was mistakenly added to Git, which required removing it from version control.
- A minor typo was found in requirements.txt for one of the libraries, which was corrected manually.
- Ensured both developers were using the same Python version to avoid compatibility issues.

##  Final Outcome:
- The process was successfully carried out.
- The project ran smoothly in both the developer's and gatekeeper's environments.
- Both roles (developer and gatekeeper) were fully practiced.

## Conclusion:
This exercise provided a practical experience of the deployment process in MLOps, helping both participants understand the flow from development to production. Communication and following version control best practices were key to ensuring a smooth transition.
